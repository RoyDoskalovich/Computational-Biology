# Computational-Biology

## Overview
This repository explores **computational biology** by applying **biological concepts** to solve problems in **computer science**. Techniques inspired by **genetic evolution, self-organization, and cellular processes** are implemented to tackle challenges such as clustering, optimization, and pattern formation.

## Contents

### [Self-Organizing Map (SOM)](./self_organization_map/README.md)
Implementation of a **Self-Organizing Map** (SOM) for **clustering handwritten digits**. The SOM uses an unsupervised neural network to create a structured representation of input data while preserving spatial relationships.

### [Genetic Algorithm for Stable Marriage Problem](./genetic_algorithm/README.md)
A **genetic algorithm** is applied to the **Stable Marriage Problem**, leveraging evolutionary strategies such as crossover, mutation, and selection to find stable matchings efficiently.

### [Cellular Automaton for Vertical Stripe Formation](./cellular_automaton/README.md)
Simulation of **vertical stripe formation** using a **cellular automaton**, inspired by biological pattern formation. The system evolves following predefined rules to generate structured stripe-like patterns over time.

Each subdirectory contains its own `README.md` with further details about the specific implementation and methodology.

##
This repository serves as an intersection between biology and computer science, demonstrating how **nature-inspired techniques** can be leveraged to solve complex computational problems.
